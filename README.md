# How to promote value co-creation through online communities——An exploration of lead user identification from the users participation perspective(unpublished)
The emergence of web 3.0 and social platforms provide a convenient way for interactions between users and providers. Focusing on the roles of users in the value co-creation, users’ participation becomes an important and prolific source of innovation and a main source of ideas for enterprises. However, not all users are equally likely to innovate but innovative activity occurs especially among lead users. Unlike with the product features of industrial manufacturing, how to identify the lead users from online communities for the industry of mass consumer products is little studied. This paper explores a new method to identify the lead users from the online communities based on index evaluation and biclustering analysis. Through data collected with 11250 community users of 54 sections from MIUI platform, an empirical study of a fast-growing Chinese handset-maker Xiaomi Tech, illustrates the proposed methods. Analysis and calculation of the practical example show that lead users including the core lead user groups and the potential lead user groups can be effectively obtained by these two kinds of methods’ similar results matching. And realizing the full participation of lead users with the goal of value co-creation in the end.
